Analysis of tweets by Citron
In this study I analyze the effect of tweets by Citron - a renowned investment research company - on the short-term and long-term stock performance companies. I initially hypothesized that after Citron's (http://www.citronresearch.com/who-is-citron-research/) comments stock prices would move significantly. My analysis analyzes the sentiment in Citron's tweets and matches them with stock performance. Also, this analysis investigates opportunities for longer term trading, if any. Morever, such effects as firm size and trading exchane are also tested.
